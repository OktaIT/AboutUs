About "OktaIT" 
=======

Who is Okta IT? As the name implies, we work in the IT Department for [Okta Inc](http://www.okta.com/).  We feel strongly about not having to re-invent the wheel, so we perodically release code projects that we've developed internally.  Since the code is open-sourced and publicly available, we welcome feedback & fixes (pull requests, patches & bugs).
